## Overview

The `cisco_tester.py` script is designed to assess multiple IP addresses for a specific Cisco vulnerability (CVE-2023-20198). It performs an HTTP or HTTPS POST request to each IP and checks for a specific string in the response to identify if the host is compromised.

## Features

- Scans multiple IP addresses in one go.
- Supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- Identifies compromised hosts based on a predefined string.
- Saves scan results to a CSV file along with a timestamp.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` Python library

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cisco_tester.git
```

## Install Required Packages
Make sure to install the requests library before running the script. Open your terminal and run:

```pip install requests```
### Or for Python 3:

```pip3 install requests```

# Usage
Running the Script
Navigate to the directory where cisco_tester.py is located.

Run the script using the command:

```python cisco_tester.py```

When prompted, enter the IP addresses you wish to scan, separated by commas.

Example
python cisco_tester.py

Enter comma-separated IP addresses: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2

## Output
The script will display the scan results on the screen and also save them in a CSV file named scan_results.csv.

The CSV file will have the following columns:

IP Address: The scanned IP address.
Status: Status of the host ("Clean" or "Compromised by CVE-2023-20198").
Timestamp: The time the scan was performed.
